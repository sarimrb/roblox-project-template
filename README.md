 4. Press "CTRL + SHIFT + P", search 'rojo start server' and press ENTER
 5. In **Roblox Studio**, open the "build.rbxlx"
 6. Publish it to **Roblox** (This is not needed but is recommended)
 7. Click the **Rojo** plugin in the plugins tab in **Roblox Studio** and click "Connect", if it doesn't work, make sure the port is set to the port **Rojo** is listening to (to check this, in **Visual Studio Code** check the output for a message from **Rojo**)
